# 12-24Hour-Clock
#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For this project I created a clock that told the time in two differenr formats and allowed you to add an hour, minute, or second to the time.

#What did you do particularly well?
I feel like overall i wrote the code very nice and allowed you to track the it line by line to see where everything has an affect on the inital time.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I feel like i could enhance the code by making it a loop so you can constantly change the time.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part was writting the code for when time would roll over such as when the seconds would than add a minute or a minute would add an hour.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I thing I learned the most was how to properly write the code section by section to ensure that it works properly and to deal with multiple things happening when things happen.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made it easier to read wrote it in order so the hour change happens first than minute than of course seconds.
